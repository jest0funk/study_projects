    "The game name is ESCAPE THE ROOM.\n",
    "It's a well-known family of quest games. The idea is that main character finds himself (wakes up) in a strange room and needs to guess a way out of it. To complete the game the player needs to look at all objects in the room and try to figure out how and what to take/use/open in order to succeed. The only win scenario is opening the room dor. The player loses if gives up so the main character remains in the room.\n",
    "The game implements following actions: \"look around\" to look around in the room, \"move\" to move across the room, \"inventory\" to show collected items. Some action require object name thay are applied to: \"look at [object]\" to look at objects in the room or in the inventory, \"take [object]\" to take an object, \"open [object]\", \"use [object]\" to use an object. There are also some supportive actions: \"hint\" to give a hint to the player, \"help\" to explain how the game input is organized, \"exit\" to exit to the main menu.\n",
    "As the latest action implies there is the main menu in the game. It is supported by folloeing actions: \"new game\" to start a new game, \"resume\" to resume the game in progress, \"description\" to explain the main idea of the game to the player, \"quit\" to quit the game.\n",
    "There are also several auxillary functions to support the gameplay and avoid some redunduncy."
