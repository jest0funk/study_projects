"A group of high school teenagers and their parents attempt to navigate the many ways the Internet has changed their relationships, their communications, their self-images, and their love lives. This movie follows the story of a group of high school teenagers and their parents as they attempt to navigate the many ways the internet has changed their relationships, their communication, their self-images, and their love lives. This movie attempts to stare down social issues such as video game culture, anorexia, infidelity, fame hunting, and the proliferation of illicit material on the internet. As each character and each relationship is tested, we are shown the variety of roads people choose - some tragic, some hopeful - as it becomes clear that no one is immune to this enormous social change that has come through our phones, our tablets, and our computers. The effect of on-line connection 24/7 is examined through a group of east Texas high school students and their parents. Don Truby (Adam Sandler) and Helen Truby's (Rosemarie Dewitt's) marriage has long been disintegrating about which they both do not speak. While Don early in their problems turned to Internet porn, he now addicted, they both eventually turn to the Internet to find extramarital sex partners to fulfill what is missing in their marriage. Their son, Chris Truby (Travis Tope), who Don discovers is also watching porn on the Internet, which Don solely sees as a rite of passage, is having increasing difficulties in maintaining an erection when it doesn't include anything he considers outside the sexual norm, which may make it difficult for him when he has his first sexual encounter probably of the vanilla variety. Allison Doss (Elena Kampouris) turns to the Internet for any support she can find in maintaining her weight loss, which she is doing solely through controlling her food intake. Her extreme weight loss is largely to attract the attention of fellow student Brandon Lender (Will Peltz), on whom she has long had a crush and who she wants to be her first kiss. It's been a year since Lydia Mooney (Candace Lantz) headed to Los Angeles, California with her boyfriend Greg Cherry (Jon Michael Davis), in the process, leaving her husband Kent Mooney (Dean Norris) and son Tim Mooney (Ansel Elgort). Football star Tim, who has come to the conclusion of one's own insignificance within the grand scheme of the cosmos, has decided not to play football this year against the wants of the school and Kent, turning to on-line gaming of the D and D variety to while away his time. What he has not told Kent is that he secretly follows his mother on Facebook to feel connected to her despite her absence. Patricia Beltmeyer (Jennifer Garner), who teaches Internet protection to other parents and students, monitors every keystroke daughter Brandy Beltmeyer (Kaitlyn Dever) does on her computer, Patricia checking the computer and Brandy's phone once a week as extra security. Although Patricia has never found anything to cause her concern, what Patricia's actions have done is drive Brandy's on-line activities that she does not want her mother to know underground. And former failed actress Donna Clint (Judy Greer) supports her daughter Hannah Clint's (Olivia Crocicchia's) drive to become famous, most specifically in becoming an actress. Donna believes the best way to achieve this goal is for Hannah to have her own webpage, which has increasingly been populated with provocative images of Hannah. Hannah takes that message from her mother a step further by portraying herself as a sexually active being in believing that is what will attract the attention of those who matter. Based on the novel of the same name by Chad Kultgen, the movie features Adam Sandler and Rosemarie DeWitt as a married couple who each use the internet to find lovers, Judy Greer as a failed actress who spends much of her time pushing her daughter's career through a website, and Jennifer Garner as a mother who takes every precaution to make sure she knows what her daughter does on-line."

Billy Madison is the 27 year-old son of Bryan Madison, a very rich man who has made his living in the hotel industry. Billy stands to inherit his father's empire but only if he can make it through all 12 grades, 2 weeks per grade, to prove that he has what it takes to run the family business. Billy Madison is a 27 year old non-working immature idiot. His father Brian Madison who runs Madison Hotels is retiring and is thinking of handing his company to Billy, but also thinking of giving it to Eric Gordon, a weasel-like co-worker of Madison Hotels. Billy strikes a deal with his father to go through grades 1-12 to earn the company. He still goofs off in school and tries to score with his teachers, including his sexy third grade teacher, Veronica Vaughn. Billy Madison is a non-working, non-educated slacker who lives entirely off his dad. He spends his day drinking beer, reading girly magazines, and hanging out by the pool. When his father realizes that Billy is unfit to run the family business, Billy decides that he must go back to school and earn a real education. He figures it will be no problem going back to high school and learning over again, until he learns that his father bought Billy's passing grades all the way back in elementary school. Thus, Billy must return to elementary school and pass each grade one at a time in a short time, or else he loses his place as heir to the company. In addition, Billy tries to win the hand of Veronica, a sexy school teacher who thinks her students are more mature than Billy."
