"Dom Toretto and his family are targeted by the vengeful son of drug kingpin Hernan Reyes. The end of the road begins. Fast X, the tenth film in the Fast and Furious Saga, launches the final chapters of one of cinema's most storied and popular global franchises, now in its third decade and still going strong with the same core cast and characters as when it began. Over many missions and against impossible odds, Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his family have outsmarted, out-nerved and outdriven every foe in their path. Now, they confront the most lethal opponent they've ever faced: A terrifying threat emerging from the shadows of the past who's fueled by blood revenge, and who is determined to shatter this family and destroy everything-and everyone-that Dom loves, forever. In 2011's Fast Five, Dom and his crew took out nefarious Brazilian drug kingpin Hernan Reyes and decapitated his empire on a bridge in Rio De Janeiro. What they didn't know was that Reyes' son, Dante (Aquaman's Jason Momoa), witnessed it all and has spent the last 12 years masterminding a plan to make Dom pay the ultimate price. Dante's plot will scatter Dom's family from Los Angeles to the catacombs of Rome, from Brazil to London and from Portugal to Antarctica. New allies will be forged and old enemies will resurface. But everything changes when Dom discovers that his own 8-year-old son (Leo Abelo Perry, Black-ish) is the ultimate target of Dante's vengeance. Directed by Louis Leterrier (Clash of the Titans, The Incredible Hulk), Fast X stars returning cast members Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges, Nathalie Emmanuel, Jordana Brewster, Sung Kang, Jason Statham, John Cena and Scott Eastwood, with Oscar® winner Helen Mirren and Oscar® winner Charlize Theron. The film also features an extraordinary new cast including Oscar® winner Brie Larson as Tess, a rogue representative from the Agency; Alan Richtson (Reacher) as Aimes, the new head of the Agency who doesn't hold the same fondness for Dom's crew as his predecessor, Mr. Nobody; Daniela Melchior (The Suicide Squad) as a Brazilian street racer with a powerful tie to Dom's past; and legendary Oscar® winner Rita Moreno as Dom and Mia's Abuelita Toretto. Fast X is produced by Neal H. Moritz, Vin Diesel, Justin Lin, Jeff Kirschenbaum and Samantha Vincent. The executive producers are Joseph M. Caracciolo, Jr., David Cain, Chris Morgan, Amanda Lewis and Mark Bomback. The final road begins! Dom Torretto and his family have made it through thick and thin together while succeeding in various missions and fighting off multiple villains. But now Dom is put to the ultimate test when he goes up against Dante Reyes, the son of an old foe who is out to exact revenge for the death of his father. With time running out and help from new allies, Dom and his family are in for the fight of their lives against the biggest enemy they have ever faced."

Construction company owner John Matthews learns that his estranged son, Jason, has been arrested for drug trafficking. Facing an unjust prison sentence for a first time offender courtesy of mandatory minimum sentence laws, Jason has nothing to offer for leniency in good conscience. Desperately, John convinces the DEA and the opportunistic DA Joanne Keeghan to let him go undercover to help make arrests big enough to free his son in return. With the unwitting help of an ex-con employee, John enters the narcotics underworld where every move could be his last in an operation that will demand all his resources, wits and courage to survive.

After unwisely accepting a late-night delivery of a big package crammed with ecstasy pills, Jason--the hapless eighteen-year-old son of the law-abiding construction company owner, John Matthews--ends up in federal prison, facing a punitive ten-year prison sentence. Determined to do anything to reduce his first-time offender son's harsh punishment, the ordinary father strikes a treacherous deal with the politically ambitious local U.S. Attorney, Joanne Keeghan, almost begging her to infiltrate the dangerous world of the local drug dealer, Malik. Somehow, John has to bring the ruthless drug dealer to justice; however, with the perspective of luring an even bigger fish--the legendary Mexican cartel kingpin, Juan Carlos ""El Topo"" Pintera--suddenly, Joanne changes the rules of the game. Is John prepared to give his life in exchange for Jason's freedom? Jason Collins (18) accepts hesitantly to delivery some ecstasy pills, which he and his girl want to try, for his buddy Craig, who takes the only possible plea bargain when told the minimal term is ten years: a short term for turning in Jason, who has no accomplice left to pass the buck and refuses to dob on principal. His father John Matthews, who neglected the knave running his own construction company bordering on disaster, finds the ambitious U.S. Attorney, Joanne Keeghan a true politician, strikes an irregular plea bargain: Jason -who is beaten in jail- out after months served if John can deliver a big fish. To that end, he identifies and bribes one of his ex-con 'social case' employees, Daniel James, who is desperate to stay within the law for his own kid son, as well-enough connected to drug dealer Malik to set a trap for Mexican cartel drug baron Juan Carlos ""El Topo"" Pintera.

And he doesn't know what she did to Marni. When they meet, she wants Joanna to apologize for the way she treated her but Joanna feigns ignorance. When Marni tells her mother, Gail (Jamie Lee Curtis), about her and Joana, Gail tells her to try and put it behind her. But when Gail meets Joana's aunt Mona (Sigourney Weaver), it turns that she's her old friend Ramona who was her best friend in high school whom she had falling out with with years ago, and Gail is unaware what caused it. Gail feels like Mona is trying to rub her success in her face. When Marni learns that Joanna does remember her she sets to expose her to her brother.

On the flight, Marni freaks out when she learns that Joanna is her arch nemesis JJ, who had bullied her in Ridgefield High School. Marni discovers that her family loves Joanna, and when she meets her, she wants Joanna to apologize for the humiliations she was subjected to in high school. But Joanna pretends that she has not recognized Marni and promises a fresh start to them. Meanwhile, Joanna's aunt Ramona (Sigourney Weaver) arrives for the wedding and Marni's mother Gail Byer (Jamie Lee Curtis) recognizes her as her high-school best friend that has become her enemy.

Marni Olivia Olsen (Kristen Bell) was able to overcome being bullied at Ridgefield High School, particularly by the clique led by head cheerleader J.J. Clark (Odette Annable), which led to her being insecure and geeky at that time, to blossom into a high-powered public relations executive, she just having been promoted to VP at her company's New York office. Between moving from Los Angeles to New York, Marni heads home to Ridgefield in Northern California to attend her older brother Will Olsen's (James Wolk) wedding, he who was her primary protector when she was a child, he providing her unconditional love, support and encouragement. She will be meeting Will's fiancée Joanna for the first time, that is until she learns that Joanna is the same J.J. that tormented her in high school. Despite not looking forward to encountering J.J. again, all Marni wants from J.J. is a sincere apology for that torment. What may be worse for Marni is that she not only doesn't get that apology, but Joanna doesn't seem to remember Marni at all. When Marni discovers that Joanna's forgetfulness about high school is all an act, Marni and J.J. go to more subversive means to one up the other, Marni in an attempt to expose Joanna as the J.J. that made her life hell both as revenge and to protect Will, and Joanna to hide that past especially from Will while seemingly continue to torment Marni. What happens is affected by: other hidden relationships between the Olsen and Clark families, namely between Marni's mother Gail Byer Olsen (Jamie Lee Curtis) and Joanna's now wealthy and highly successful Aunt Ramona (Jamie Lee Curtis), the two who used to be friends ""until;"" and the reentry of men in Joanna and Marni's lives, Tim (Kyle Bornheimer) who dated Joanna in college, and Charlie Mason (Sean Wing), a popular kid on whom Marni had a crush in high school.

Her entire family, including the dog, find Joanna adorable, and are also taken in by her wealthy aunt Ramona (Sigourney Weaver). Her attempts to warn Will go in vain, and when confronted, Joanna refuses to tender an apology. Things only get worse after Marni falls into an ant-trap, ends up with bite-marks on her face, loses her contacts, is forced to wear thick glasses, and ends up looking like a member of the 'geek squad'--just in time for the wedding.

Streetwise mobster-turned-movie producer Chili Palmer is back, but this time Chili has abandoned the fickle movie industry and veered into the music business, tangling with Russian mobsters and gangsta rappers and taking a talented, feisty young singer named Linda Moon under his wing. From the recording studio to an Aerosmith concert to the MTV Music Awards, he manipulates events to watch them play out the Chili way, using his signature blend of wiseguy skills and negotiation tactics. It's a dangerous business, and everyone's looking for their next big hit. In this sequel to ""Get Shorty"", Chili Palmer is tired of the movie production business after being forced to make a useless sequel starring Martin Weir. When a music producer friend is gunned down, he offers to help his widow run the business. Checking a talent that the producer had been talking to him about puts Chili at odds with a sleazy music manager, his gay bodyguard, and his equally sleazy partner. The mismanagement of the music company also gets Chili threatened by members of the Russian mafia and a suburban rap-mogul producer & his thugs led by his bumbling relative. All turns out well when it is determined that the dead producer's wife had at one time been the laundress for Aerosmith and making contact with Aerosmith leader Steven Tyler at a Lakers game, gets their protégé a duet with Tyler at an Aerosmith concert."

With the old cedar mill gone out of business for good--and a garish gambling house opened instead, promoting drugs and violence thanks to his old high-school nemesis, Jay Hamilton--Chris will have no other choice but to take matters into his own hands as the town's new sheriff.

Who will dare to stop Chris, the furious one-man-army? When a former member of the U.S. Army Special Forces returns to his small hometown in rural Washington State hoping to realise a childhood dream of working in the local lumber mill, he discovers that much has changed, as the normally tranquil town is now besieged by drugs, outbreaks of violence and a general feeling of malaise and terror, with many pointing a finger at the influence of a crooked casino where his ex-girlfriend now works as a dancer.
