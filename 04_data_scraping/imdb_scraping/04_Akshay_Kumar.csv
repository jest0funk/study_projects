"An ethnic Canadian hockey player struggles against traditional family values and discrimination from mainstream hockey players. A hockey enthusiast since 12 years of age, Toronto-based Rajvinder Singh, even went to the extent of trimming his hair, discarding his Pagri/turban, did not complete his education, incurred the wrath of his father, Darvesh, who wanted him to be involved in the family business as well as confirm and respect Sikh religion principles and values. Hoping to play professional hockey, Rajvinder, along with other fellow Sikh players, instead finds himself treated as the object of ridicule, referred to as a 'joker', by mainstream Caucasian players. Even his friends tease him and ask him to take up 'Guli Danda' and Kabaddi', while his father makes him work for Uncle Sammy as a truck driver. He is attracted to stunning law student Melissa Winters while her brother, Dan, offers to coach Rajvinder and his team. Unable to get themselves included in any team, they form their own, and call it 'Speedy Singhs'. They then set about to make a name for themselves with a coach who is unable to pronounce their names, and assumes that they belong to the same family as all their last names are 'Singh'. The team, headed by Rajvinder, has an uphill task, challenging the reigning champions 'Hammerheads', while Rajvinder must counsel his school-going brother, Gurveer, who is being harassed for looking 'different', deal with family pressures - especially after Darvesh announces that his son has forsaken hockey once and for all. Twenty-something Rajveer Singh, a second generation Canadian of Sikh descent, still lives at home with his parents and his preteen brother Gurveer in Toronto despite Raj often being at loggerheads with his traditional father, Darvesh Singh. In acts of rebellion against that traditionalism, Raj recently dropped out of college and long ago cut his hair and stopped wearing a turban. Their disagreements of late have been of a more fundamental nature about life goals. Darvesh's view of the Canadian dream is to work hard at a conventional job to become wealthy, he seeing Raj some day take over Darvesh's younger brother Sammy Singh's multi-million dollar trucking business where both Darvesh and Raj work in the yard, something that would probably not sit well with Sammy's soon to be son-in-law Sonu, who talks and acts big. Raj's view of the Canadian dream is to do what makes you happy, which for him means hockey, from Darvesh's perspective a ""white man"" game. Among his Sikh friends with who he plays pickup, Raj is not only the only one with inherent talent but that takes the game seriously. And while Raj is arguably more talented than anyone on the Hammerheads, a team on which he aspires to be a player, they who play in the Hyundai Cup League just under the minor leagues, they only see him as a Sikh who has no business playing the game, period. In meeting Dan Winters, the maintenance man at the rink where they play and learning that he once was a major league player, albeit in only four games, Raj is not only able eventually to convince him to coach them, but Dan is able to convince them that pending his assessment that they should play in the Hyundai Cup League truly to test their mettle with the sport. Through Dan, Raj also meets Melissa Winters, Dan's younger sister who is currently living with him while she attends law school, Raj's other goal being for Melissa to fall for him. With these items in Raj's life, the question becomes if there is any way for Raj and Darvesh to see and understand the other's perspective truly to become family again."

"Ishwar Chandra Thakur is living the good life, content with his loving wife Sumitra and son Adiya. There is but one thing which gradually comes to annoy Ishwar: his son's laziness and dependency on his father. Ishwar Chandra Thakur is living the good life, content with his loving wife Sumitra and son Adiya. There is but one thing which gradually comes to annoy Ishwar: his son's laziness and dependency on his father. When Adiya marries his father's enemy's daughter and gets her pregnant, Ishwar decides to teach his son a lesson in the poverty that he himself experienced and fought himself out of. Waqt is the story of a father and a son between whom there is a special bond. Unlike many other father son relationships, these two are more like friends; the father being Ishwar Sharawat and his son Aditya .Ishwar is the owner of a toy manufacturing company and is extremely generous and big hearted making sure to spread as much as joy to kids as he can, and that is why he makes sure that during the festive season of Diwali he distributes toys to the orphans. On the surface Ishwar's life seems like something every man would crave for; a great and profitable business, a loving son and a caring and dutiful wife Sumitra or so it seems. Aditya is in love with Mitali and vice-versa who is the daughter of Nathu. However after the initial problems that occur, the two of them finally end up getting married. Ishwar hopes that marriage will make Aditya a more responsible man but he is disappointed. His efforts to turn Aditya into a more responsible individual turn futile. One thing leads to another and Ishwar doesn't have an option but to throw Aditya out of the house. Aditya is shocked that the same doting father is now behaving in this fashion towards him and his now pregnant wife. After the initial problems, Aditya takes it upon himself to take care of his wife and his unborn kid. Aditya starts working as freelance stuntman and at the same time prepares for a star search contest. Aditya starts turning into an independent man but the rift in the relationship between him and his father grows. In the climax of the film Aditya has been chosen to participate in the finals of the star search contest and this is where all the reasons of the father's cruel behavior are exposed and this forms the end of the story when the father and son get back together. Ishwar Chandra Thakur never had it so good in his life before. He has a faithful and loving wife in Sumitra, who he affectionately calls Sumi; and a good rapport with his only child, a son named Aditya, who he affectionately calls Adi, and a servant named Laxman, who is not exactly the brightest star on the horizon. So what if Adi has failed his matriculation exams, so what if Adi is unable to secure any job; so what if Adi has no skills whatsoever to land any job; so what if Adi is lazy and a slacker; so what if Adi marries his critic's daughter, Pooja,; so what if Adi wants to be dependent on him all his life; so what if Adi is about to become a dad....but wait a minute. Why would he let Adi & his children depend on him? Didn't he himself start his life with a mere Rs.35/-, didn't he work as a mailman and toy salesman? These thoughts overwhelm both Sumi and Ishwar, and they ask Adi to get out of their house and live in the servants' outhouse, which they do so. But again, Adi reaches a state of vegetation, without making any effort to find any employment, and it is then Ishwar asks him to pay rent of Rs.1500/ and a Electricity deposit of Rs.5000/- or else even this shelter will be taken away from him. With Pooja pregnant and expecting a baby shortly, Adi will really have to come to terms or be out on the streets, living on the footpath - with no future prospects whatsoever for him, Pooja, or his newborn child. But without any skills or education, what possibly can Adi do to earn money? And what is the real reason why his dad threw him out of the family home?"

The crime rate rises with more smuggling, trading and illegal activities soaring. Meanwhile, the CBI work constantly to stop this. Inspector Vikram is a failure of a police in life and tends to stick with the easy way. Appa is an encounter specialist who goes after the henchmen instead of the bosses, he has a wife Janki with whom they have a son. Const. Khaled is a happy-go-lucky cop.

Shyam has come to the city so that he can return Rs.35000/- he borrowed from Kharak Singh (Om Puri), who in turn needs the money to get his sister married. Baburao needs money to pay off his debtors. And to add to this chaos, Baburao keeps on getting a series of wrong numbers on his telephone, asking for Deviprasad. One day he gets a call from Kabira (Gulshan Grover) who demands a ransom from Baburao, thinking it is Deviprasad (Kulbhushand Kharbanada). The trio decide to ""liase"" between the victim's dad and the kidnappers, and keep some of the money for themselves. Murphy's Law prevails, and things get even more hilariously chaotic, as the trio are on the run from Kabeera; the police; more wrong numbers; and Kharak Singh. Raju and Shyam are boarders at a hostel owned by their friend Babu Rao. All the three friends are in dire need (and have fantasies) of big money. Babu Rao needs money to pay back debts his father incurred, Raju needs money to send to his mother and Shyam needs money to pay back Kharak Singh, a villager friend with a wedding to arrange quickly. Of these, Shyam is the only one to get a job, but he sacrifices it to Anu, a woman with serious troubles (and with whom he eventually develops a hate-to-love relationship). One day, a gangster named Kabira kidnaps the granddaughter of millionaire Devi Prasad. But when he calls Babu Rao's telephone number by mistake to demand the ransom, Raju sees the answer to all their money problems. He suggests they play a game, and do some ""hera pheri"" - and that's when the trouble starts..."
