"Three unlikely heroes - Nachi, a free-spirited coati; Xochi, a fearless monarch butterfly and Pako, a hyperactive glass frog - embark on an adventure to stop wicked coral snake Zaina from destroying their rain forest homeland. Set in a hidden rainforest of Latin America, Koati tells the story of three unlikely friends who embark on a journey to save their home, ""The Land of Xo,"" and along the way discover that anyone, including themselves, can be the hero of their own story. The Land of Xo is where reality and fantasy meet - a place where real forces of nature intertwine with the magic and mysticism of our ancestors and our folklore. Among Xo's least ""important"" inhabitants is an orphaned coati named NACHI - a free-spirited, natural born rebel and loner. As an orphan, Nachi learned to be on his own and fend for himself. He is proud of his street-savvy smarts and doesn't think he needs anybody. Luckily, there are those in Xo who know even loners need a community. They include AMAYA, a quetzal bird and mother figure for Xo's misfit children. And BALAM, a wise black jaguar who is Xo's benevolent leader. Amaya loves Nachi as if he were her own son. Balam treats Nachi like his apprentice, showing him what it truly means to be a leader. When our story begins Xo and its inhabitants are being threatened by a series of devastating earthquakes. Balam gathers his council to advise him on the best way forward. Present at the council's meting is COCOPA, the ancient armadillo and sacred shaman of Xo, and ZAINA, a smart but manipulative coral snake. When Cocopa suggests they stay and protect their land, Zaina feigns diplomacy to Balam, recommending they migrate South and tries to convince him, and others, that Xo is no longer safe. But really, she is power-hungry and only using this crisis for her own gain, wanting a new land that she can rule - not as a wise leader, but as an all-powerful queen. In essence it is Zaina, and not the earthquakes, that might be more dangerous to the future of this community. Unfortunately, before a decision is made another massive earthquake hits Xo. And in a heroic attempt to save lives, Balam is killed, leaving everyone, especially Nachi, devastated and without a leader. Zaina quickly seizes power and uses her seductive charm to persuade the mourning inhabitants to leave Xo and follow her to a new land. Nachi is not fooled by her charm and knows she can't be trusted. So he decides to turn to Cocopa for guidance, knowing it is what Balam would've wanted him to do. But Cocopa's advice is not so cut and dry. He tells Nachi that he must go on a journey to find the answers he seeks. There are those who do follow Zaina and her enormous, albeit tiny-brained henchman, the anaconda JITHU, to a new land. But Nachi takes Cocopa's advice and ventures off on his own quest. Despite his wish to do this journey alone, PAKO, a rambunctious glass frog, appoints himself Nachi's travel buddy. Being a glass frog, Pako is incapable of concealing his feelings - neither physically nor emotionally, which at first annoys Nachi to no end. But ultimately, it is Pako's sentimental nature that helps Nachi open up and let others in. Another initially unwanted tag-along, is XOCHI, a beautiful, precocious monarch butterfly who lacks any social boundaries, but who is utterly fearless. Together, our trio will discover the cause of the earthquakes, find a solution, reunite with their tribe and rebuild The Land of Xo stronger than before. Because anyone - even a coati, a glass frog, and a monarch butterfly, can be the hero of their own story."

Carl Casper is an acclaimed chef with a family life that seems as decaying as his artistic freedom. Those frustrations boil over into a raucous viral-videoed public confrontation against a restaurant critic who panned his cooking of food that his boss ordered him to make against his instincts. Now with his career ruined, Carl's ex-wife offers an unorthodox solution in Miami: refit an old food truck to offer quality cooking on his own terms. Now with his young son, Percy, and old colleague, Martin, helping, Carl takes a working trip across America with that truck to rediscover his gastronomic passion. With Percy's tech savvy and Martin's enthusiasm, Carl finds that he is creating a traveling sensation on the way home. In doing so, Carl discovers he is serving up more than simply food, but also a deeper connection with his life and his family that is truly delicious in its own way. Miami-born Carl Casper is the head chef of Gauloise in Brentwood, California.

Carl may not realize how much this stifling has affected his psyche, that negativity which led to the dissolution of his marriage to Inez, and he having a strained relationship with his and Inez's ten year old son Percy, who only wants to spend quality time with his physically present but mentally absent father in their mandated time together. In being a social media newbie, Carl ends up having a very public breakdown. In the aftermath, Carl, with nothing else he wants to do but be a chef, has to reinvent himself in some manner to get back on his feet.

Carl Casper is a disillusioned chef fed up with his restaurant's management, poor reviews and lack of creativity. After an online battle with a well-known critic leads to further frustration, Carl decides to leave and go solo as a food truck operator in a bid to rediscover his flair for cooking."

"Fioravante decides to become a professional Don Juan as a way of making money to help his cash-strapped friend, Murray. With Murray acting as his ""manager"", the duo quickly finds themselves caught up in the crosscurrents of love and money. Murray, the bankrupt owner of a bookstore, is forced to close his family business. His dermatologist, Dr. Parker, dreams of having a threesome and would pay a thousand dollars to have one with her friend Selima. Murray then proposes to his friend Fioravante that they start a male prostitution business, with Murray acting as the pimp. However, when Fioravante meets a Hasidic Jewish woman, Avigal, who is the widow of a rabbi, they fall in love with each other. But a Jewish neighborhood patrolman, Dovi, is in love with Avigal too, and might make life difficult for Fioravante and Murray. In a predominantly Jewish neighborhood of Brooklyn, elderly Murray Schwartz is forced to close his rare used books bookstore - opened originally by his grandfather - due to poor business, leaving him in financial straits, he already living in a platonic situation with an African-American single mother named Othella and her large brood of children. He stumbles onto a potential opportunity to get out of the hole stemming from a casual social conversation with his wealthy, married dermatologist, Dr. Parker. Dr. Parker and her Latina friend Selima want to engage in a ménage à trois, and want to find that male third, she asking Murray if he knows anyone suitable. Murray responds that he does - for a hefty price. Who he wants to ""pimp out"" is his long time friend, middle-aged Fioravante, as although Fioravante is not traditionally handsome - something that Fioravante readily admits - he knows how to treat women. Fioravante, too, is in financial straits with his only current income coming from working two days a week at a florist shop, and the occasional freelance plumbing job. To help both himself and Murray out, Murray who would get a percentage of the cut, Fioravante reluctantly agrees, with both Dr. Parker and Selima wanting to take solo test drives with Fioravante before the big threesome. Murray and Fioravante's new oldest profession business becomes a successful one, their clients, including Dr. Parker ad Selima, who adore the fact that Fioravante is not a pretty boy but a real man who focuses more on them than on himself. Although doing it primarily for the money, both Murray and Fioravante have a benevolent side to their business as Murray believes Fioravante's caring nature would benefit an orthodox Jewish acquaintance, Avigal, who has been unable to move on emotionally with her life in a holistic sense following the death of her rabbi husband two years ago. Fioravante's non-sexual service for Avigal would be under the guise of a healing massage. Problems for the business may surface as Avigal embarking on something like this would be against her orthodox Jewish beliefs. Dovi, the head of Shomrim, an orthodox Jewish neighborhood patrol group, he who is Avigal's childhood friend and who has long been in love with her, may suspect that these strange men that he doesn't know - Murray and Fioravante - have led Avigal astray, potentially into an illegal endeavor. Further complications may ensue if any of Fioravante, Dr. Parker, Selima and/or Avigal see their individual business relationship in this regard moving into a more personal one, where true feelings of love begin to emerge."
